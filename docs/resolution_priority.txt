If the program is run for the first time, the program 
will quit in between the process. The reason is that 
the desired resolution is not set. A list of 
resolutions can be found in the following folder. 
`
docs/video_resolutions_landscape.txt
docs/video_resolutions_portrait.txt
`
To set your desired resolution, you simply have to 
put `@` symbol before the desired resolution. For 
example:
`
@1920x1080
`
You can also set an optional resolution if the 
desired resolution is not found. You simply have to 
put `#` symbol before the optional resolution. For 
example:
`
#1280x720
`
If both of them is not found then the best option 
detected by yt-dlp will be downloaded.
